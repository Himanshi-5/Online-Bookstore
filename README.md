# Online-Bookstore

📚 ****Online Bookstore – SQL Guided Project ( by Satish Dhawale Sir)**

This project is a guided SQL exercise that simulates an Online Bookstore.
It demonstrates how to design a relational database, import data, and solve real-world business queries using SQL.

📂 **Database Design**

**Books Table** → Stores book details (title, author, genre, price, stock)

**Customers Table** → Stores customer information (name, email, phone, country)

**Orders Table** → Stores customer orders (book purchased, quantity, total amount, date)

🔍 **Business Questions Answered**

✔ Retrieve all books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy)
✔ Find books published after a certain year
✔ Get customers from a specific country (e.g., Canada)
✔ Show orders placed within a specific month (e.g., Nov 2021)
✔ Calculate total stock and revenue
✔ Identify the most expensive & cheapest books
✔ Find the most frequently ordered book
✔ List top authors by total sales
✔ Show customers who spent the most money
✔ Track remaining stock after fulfilling all orders

🛠 **Skills Learned**

SQL Queries (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY)

Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Subqueries and filtering with conditions

PostgreSQL database operations (DDL & DML)

📌 Note: This is a guided project by "Satish Dhawale Sir" that I practiced to strengthen my SQL skills.
